Welcome to **CalcWiz**! 

I’m a calculus enthusiast who thinks about derivatives and integrals every single day. The elegance and power of calculus fascinates me, and I created this app to make the process of differentiating and integrating functions more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. The very fact that the differntials and integrals are calculated in a second, without those lengthy page scribbles we learnt in Grade 12 does add a note of fun to it. 

If you’re as obsessed with calculus as I am, you’ll find this tool to be your perfect companion for tackling derivatives and integrals with ease.
